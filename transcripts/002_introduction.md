Hi, my name is Mosh, and I'm going to be your instructor in this Python course.
In this course, you're going to learn everything you need to get started programming in Python.
Python is one of the most popular programming languages, and every day people use it to do cool things like automation, they use it in AI, as well as building applications and websites like Instagram and Dropbox.
So if you're looking for a job, Python is for you.
In this course I'm going to teach you everything you need to get started with Python.
We're going to talk about all the core concepts in Python, and then we're going to build three Python projects together.
Here's the first project we're going to build.
We're going to learn how to create this beautiful website for an imaginary grocery store. Here on the homepage we can see all of the products in the shop, and we also have an admin area for managing the stock.
We're going to build this using a popular Python framework called Django.
Now if you have never built a website before, don't worry, I will teach you everything from scratch.
You're also going to learn how to use Python in machine learning, or artificial intelligence.
So you will learn how to write a Python programming that will predict the music that people like based on their profile. Just like how YouTube recommends videos based on the videos you have watched before.
I will also show you python to automate boring repetitive tasks that waste your time.
You will write a Python program that will process thousands of spreadsheets in under a second.
I've designed this Python course for anyone who wants to learn Python.
If you're a beginner, don't worry, I will hold your hand through this entire course.
You're not too old or too young, and Python is super easy to learn.
You can write your first Python program in literally seconds.
Plus I'm going to give you plenty of exercises to help you build your confidence writing cool Python programs.
My name is Mosh, I'm a software engineer with two decades of experience and I've taught over 3 million people how to code. I'm super excited to be teaching you Python in this course.
So I hope you stick around and learn this beautiful powerful programming language.
