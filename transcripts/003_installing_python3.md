# Installing Python 3

In this tutorial I'm going to show you how to download
and install Python on your computer. So the first thing I want you to do,
is open up your browser and head over to Python
org. On this page click on downloads,
02:08
here you can see the latest version of Python currently, at the time of recording this video
02:12
the latest version is python 3.7.2.
02:16
Chances are in the future, when you are watching this tutorial, there is a newer
02:20
version of Python available, don't worry, all the materials you're going to learn in this course
02:24
will apply to the latest version of Python as well. So let's go ahead
02:28
and download Python 3, alright now,
02:32
look at your downloads folder, here, we should have Python 3 installer
02:36
simply double click that, if you're on Windows
02:40
you're going to see this check box here, add Python to
02:44
python, this is really important, make sure to tick this box, otherwise you're not going to be able to
02:48
follow this tutorial. If you're on a Mac,
02:52
you're going to see an installer like this, with this setup wizard we're going to install Python 3
02:56
on our computer. So simply click continue, and again,
03:00
and again, and agree with the license agreement, and
03:04
install it, this is going to take a few seconds so I'm going
03:08
to pause the recording.
03:12
Alright, we have successfully installed Python 3 on our computer.
03:16
Let's close this. Alright, next we need to install
03:20
a code editor, we se a code editor to write our code, just like
03:24
how we use Microsoft Word to write documents, we use a code editor to write
03:28
code. Now there are so many code editors out there, the one that I'm going to show you in this
03:32
tutorial is PyCharm. That is one of the most popular code editors
03:36
for writing Python code. You can get it from jetbrains.com
03:40
/pycharm. Now more accurately pycharm
03:44
is considered an IDE, which is short for integrated development
03:48
environment. And that's basically a code editor on steroids,
03:52
it has some additional features that makes it really easy to write code. So
03:56
let's go ahead and download PyCharm. Now here on the
04:00
download page, you can see two versions of PyCharm, one is the professional addition
04:04
which has additional features and you have to pay for them. The other is the
04:08
community edition, that is absolutely free, and that's what we're going to use in this tutorial.
04:12
So, go ahead and download this as well.
04:16
Now, once again look at your downloads folder, once again you should have pycharm
04:20
so double click this, now if you're
04:24
in Windows you're going to see an installation wizard, simply click next, next, next
04:28
until you install pycharm. If you're on Mac you need to drag and drop this icon
04:32
onto the applications folder, so drag and drop,
04:36
alright, now let's double click this to run it,
04:40
the first time we run pycharm we're going to get this warning, because this is an application
04:44
that we download from the internet. So let's go ahead and open it,
04:48
next you're going to see this dialogue box for importing some settings, leave this to
04:52
do not import settings, it doesn't really matter. Okay,
04:56
On this page, select I've never used PyCharm you can see some keyword
05:00
shortcuts that might be useful in the future, just accept this, and down at the bottom,
05:04
click the next button. And then next again,
05:08
one more time, and then finally start using pycharm.
05:12
So here's the main page of PyCharm every time you open
05:16
it, click on create new project,
05:20
this is the location for our project, let's call our project Hello
05:24
World. Now before click and create, expand
05:28
this item here, make sure that base interpreter is set to Python
05:32
3. Python interpreter is basically a program
05:36
that knows how to execute Python code, it will know how to interpret
05:40
or translate Python instructions into instructions a computer can understand.
05:44
Now, Mac computers, by default come with an older
05:48
installation of Python, that's Python 2, it's considered legacy
05:52
which means it's no longer maintained or supported. So earlier we downloaded
05:56
Python 3, make sure that this is set to Python 3, if not
06:00
from this list, select Python 3.7.
06:04
Alright, now let's go ahead and create this project,
06:08
