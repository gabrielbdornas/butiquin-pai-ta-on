#Math Functions

make sure to watch his tutorial one more time.
In this tutorial, we're going to look at a few useful functions for working with numbers let's start by defining a variable like x and set it to 2.9. 
Now to round this number we can use the built in round function, so we call the round function, give it x, and then print the result. 
Let's run this program so, we get 3, we have another useful built in function called abs which is short for absolute, and this is the absolute function we have in math, we give it a value and it always returns the positive representation of this value, even if the value is negative.
Here's an example. 
Let's call the abs function and give it negative 2.9 When we run this program we're gong to see 2.9 on the terminal. 
So let's go ahead there you go. 
So absolute always returns a positive number.
But technically in Python we have a handful of built in functions for performing mathematical operations, if you want to write a program that involves complex mathematical calculations, you need to import the math module.
A module in Python is a separate file with some reusable code. 
We use these modules to organize our code into different files. 
As a metaphor think of a super market. 
When you go to a super market ou see different sections for fruits and vegetables, cleaning products, junk food and so on. 
Each section in the super market is like a module in Python. 
So in Python we have this math module which contains a bunch f rustable functions for performing mathematical calculations.
So, let me show you how to use this module. 
On the top we type import, math, all in lowercase with this we can import the math module. 
Now math is an object like a string, so we can access it's functions or more accurately it's methods using the dot operator. 
So if you type math. 
Look these are all the mathematical functions available in this module. 
For example you can call the seal method to get the sealing of a number. 
So if you pass 2.9 here and then print the result we should see 3.
Let me delete all this other code here. 
Alright, let's run this program there you go. 
So we get 3. 
Another useful method is the floor method, so let's give that a try, floor of 2.9. 
What do you think we're going to get? We get 2. 
Now there are so many functions built in this module and we don't really have time to go through all of them. 
But let me show you how we can learn about them on your own.
Open up your browser and search for Python 3 math module. 
Make sure to add the version python 3.
Because the math module in python 2 is slightly different from the math module in python 3. 
So python 3 math module, now here you can see the documentation of this kind of module let's go let's have a look, if you scroll down, we can see the list of all the functions and their explanation.
So as an exercise I encourage you to have a quick look at this documentation. 
See what functions are there for you in case you need them.
