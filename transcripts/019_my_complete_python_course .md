Hey, I just wanted to make a quick announcement. 
In case you haven't seen my website yet, head over to codewithmosh.com this is my coding school, where you can find plenty of courses on web and mobile application development. 
In fact recently I published a comprehensive python course that goes way beyond this beginners youtube. 
And if you're serious about learning python and getting a job, I highly encourage you to enroll in this course. 
Just like this tutorial you can watch it anytime, anywhere as many times as you want, and you will also receive a certificate of completion that you can add to your resume, and the course comes with a 30 day money back guarantee, so if you're not happy we'll give all your money back, no questions ask. 
The price for this course is 149 dollars, but the first 200 students can get it for only 15 dollars. 
So if you're interested,
